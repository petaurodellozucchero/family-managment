# Firebase Configuration Required

This file is a placeholder. You need to download your actual `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from the Firebase Console.

## Instructions:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Click on the iOS icon or "Add app"
4. Register your app with bundle ID: `com.example.familyManagment`
5. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
6. Add this file to your iOS project in Xcode or place it in the `ios/Runner/` directory

For detailed instructions, see [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](../../FIREBASE_SETUP.md) in the project root.

**IMPORTANT**: This file should never be committed to version control. It's listed in `.gitignore` for security.
